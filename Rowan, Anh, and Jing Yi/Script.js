// Critical Lens: Countless ecological crises, including threats to whale health, are attributed to anthropocentrism. Drawing upon Katherine Hayles’ integrated cognitive framework (ICF), we contest anthropocentrism by “humanizing” whales as independent actors in relation to humans. Hayles also argues that “cognitive assemblages,” or decision-making collectives of humans, nonhumans, and computational media, determine the choices that humans make (2025). Humans are actually not as self-determining as anthropocentrism would like them to believe (Hayles, 2025). Their assumptions are formed and mediated by computational media (Hayles, 2025). As a game that has been traditionally framed as the intellectual pursuit of objective truths, Jeopardy is an example of a cognitive assemblage that impacts human decision-making. By playing our Jeopardy game on whale health, human users confront their “dehumanization” and simultaneous “humanization” of whales, re-learning cognition as something that is possessed by all species. The language of our Jeopardy questions will solely refer to humans by their species name, *homo sapiens*, and explore “humane” aspects of whale health, migration, habitats, families, and communities. Additionally, instead of rewarding players with more points for selecting more difficult questions, we will reward players for choosing to confront increasingly uncomfortable topics of anthropocentric shipping, pollution, and extractive practices, and their impacts on whale health. By employing Jeopardy’s epistemic authority and the anti-anthropocentric ICF, our Jeopardy module reframes whale health not as an isolated environmental tragedy but as a consequence of widespread and harmful anthropocentrism.

    //Future components to implement: 
    //- A "Learn More" button that is present on each question's pop-up dialogue. This button will redirect the user to an external source that provides more information on the specific topic that the question is focused on. We will have to ensure that when the user clicks the link, it opens in a new tab. This is likely something that we will discuss during office hours to learn the implementation. 
    //- A tutorial page that the user clicks through before they begin playing the game. The user can also access the tutorial to refresh their memory at any point during the game by selecting a “Game Tutorial” button. The tutorial provides an overview of how to play our Jeopardy-inspired game. This tutorial uses a <v-carousel> component that slides through still images accompanied by written explanations. These explanations will draw attention to some of the features of the game designed to resist anthropocentrism. We will emphasize our use of humanizing language to discuss whales and dehumanizing language to discuss humans.
    //- A "Resources" button which opens a pop-up dialogue in the form of a card. This card contains an easy-to-access, annotated bibliography of resources informing the content of our game. By creating opportunities for the user to become further invested in the lives and well-being of whales, our goal is to motivate the user to voluntarily confront the uncomfortability of anthropocentrism. The “Resources” button grants the user the chance to take their education and capacity for advocacy into their own hands.

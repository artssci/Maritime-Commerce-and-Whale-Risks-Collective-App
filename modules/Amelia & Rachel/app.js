            Fewer than 336 individuals remain, and the population has declined to its lowest level in more than 20 years (Johnson, et al., 2022). 
            Historically hunted almost to extinction because they were considered the “right” whales to catch, swimming slowly, staying close to shore, 
            and floating after death, the species now faces modern threats such as vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement 
            (International Whaling Commission, n.d.). To reduce disturbance and collision risk, United States federal law requires vessels to stay at least 
            500 yards away from these whales when encountered at sea. Despite decades of protection, North Atlantic right whales remain critically vulnerable

Humpback whale movement is also common farther from the mainland coast as the mammals travel towards Madagascar (Palacios et al., 2025). These routes interact heavily with the Mozambique and Hormuz Straits, which are also located along eastern Africa and southern Asia. In addition to humpback whales in the region, sperm whale populations have also been observed travelling from the eastern coast of Madagascar towards Mauritius (Palacios et al., 2025; Chambault et al., 2021). Sperm whales following these movement patterns may be at particular risk of interacting with shipping vessels from the Mozambique Strait, especially considering the long stretches of surface time they require following deep oceanic dives (Rochon, 2025).",

            title: "Malacca Strait",
            text: 'The Malacca Strait connects the Indian and Pacific Oceans through ports on the coasts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore (Thia-Eng et al., 2000). 94,000 ships travel through the Strait annually, carrying approximately 30% of all global trading goods (Feingold & Willige, 2024). The channel runs over 800km long but is only 65km wide at its most narrow point (Britannica Editors, 2026a), making it prone to ship congestion and whale-ship collisions, and posing significant risk to the gray, humpback, and blue whales that migrate through surrounding waters (Feingold & Willige, 2024; Wang et al., 2025).',
